####_What are your overall objectives for the project? What problem(s) are you solving? What user goals are you making possible?_

Objectives:

  - To provide a resource for what to do when you’re feeling badly
  - Pep talks on demand - because sometimes it’s hard to reach out to friends and family
  - Keep a strategy of what to do when it’s hard to remember where to begin
  - To empower the user to help themselves -- not preaching how they should live their lives, but offering a platform where they can keep resources that help them manage stress/deal with general moods
  - Customizable so that it’s actually useful for the user, but not just a blank slate which can be intimidating (“a starting place”)

Problems I am solving:

  - Offering a private and personal resource for when talking to someone else isn’t an option/won’t help
  - Suggesting strategies but giving the user ample opportunity to tailor/customize to meet their needs
  - Suggesting a starting point for how to feel better when feeling overwhelmed/stressed (checklist, linked resources)
  - External resource helps you get out of your own head -- when your own internal monologue is not cutting it and you need external reassurance

User goals I make possible:

  - To have a strategy to feel better for when I’m feeling low - to have a plan to refer to rather than trying to address it anew every time
  - Remind the user of the good things in their life that it is easy to lose sight of/perspective
  - This is a resource to remind you of your resources! To self-motivate, to help combat stress/general negative moods -- multiple resources in one place so that the user doesn’t have to put work into finding them in various other apps/websites

####_What is/are the main takeaways from your research findings?_

Observations:

  - The people I interviewed generally didn’t use any self-help/motivational/mood apps, but they all seemed interested in my idea when I told them about it at the end because of its interactive and customizable/add-your-own-content features

Insights:

  - The interviewees would like to be encouraged to reach out to friends
  - They have strategies and ideas to feel better when they feel down, but in the moment it’s hard to remember

Recommendations:

  - The interviewees suggested a visual way to up their moods, with some sort of photo gallery of images that make them feel good
  - They like the idea of having links to further resources -- videos/reading/informational websites
  - They thought that having a pep talk scheduled in the calendar before a certain upcoming stressful event would be beneficial

####_New topics/open questions:_
  - One interviewee suggested I look into principles of Mindfulness to help remind the user of a starting place to feel better


####_Who is your target audience?_
  - People interested in taking an active approach to feeling better
  - I assume that will be people ages 18-30, if I had more time to research, I’d find out how gender and age really do play into it

####_What features will you include? They should map to your user goals. Make sure you offer a coherent rationale for why they were chosen._
- A list of pep talks that the user can swipe through or access as a list, saved in Firebase
  - Shows one pep talk, and the user can decide if it was helpful or if they want to see another one
  - Considering offering to make different lists with different themes/for different purposes, but at this point, just having one list of the pep talks and one list for the checklist should suffice to meet user goals
- Emergency pep talk widget
  - The intention of this app is to offer support when you need it, and sometimes making the choice to go into the app  won’t occur to the user, but by having a widget on the home screen that can launch a pep talk directly from there might encourage the user to use this resource further
  - Let user identify which pep talk from the list should come up as default in the widget
- Checklist(s)
  - I will pre-populate with ideas, but the user will be able to edit mine/add to the list
  - Things to consider when you're feeling shitty, i.e. When was the last time you ate? Did you get enough sleep? Drink some water, take a deep breath. Do you need to be alone, or would you rather have some company?
  - Suggestions for Mindfulness techniques
- Links to external resources
  - For if the user needs more ideas of what to do
  - Embed audio or videos (icing)
- Sync to calendar, set a pep talk "alarm" before important events
  - This app is meant to help deal with stress as it is happening, but my interviews showed that the user may want to plan ahead and schedule a pep talk when they know something stressful is coming up
- Encourage reaching out to friends
  - Link to immediately open Facebook, email, text
  - "This pep talk wasn't enough? Maybe reach out to a friend, I know they'd love to hear from you!"
- Photo gallery/camera
  - Visual rather than verbal representation of good sentiments -- my interviews showed that the user may want to have access to pictures that make them feel good
- Incorporate sentiment analysis of text
  - Maybe as an option when inserting your own pep talks, you can perform a sentiment analysis which may encourage you to change the tone of the pep talk
- Might incorporate inspirational quotations, if I can find a good source or API

####_How will this differentiate from your competitors? What pain points are being addressed?_
- From my competitive research, I’ve identified three types of apps in this genre:
  - Mood tracking apps that focus on statistical trends 
  - Motivational/inspirational apps that show videos and links to motivational speeches
  - Mental health apps that give you specific tips for getting over mental illness/other issues like substance abuse - CBT, etc.
- My app is more personal and intimate. It will begin by offering a broader solutions and pep talks, but it will then be customized to incorporate the user’s own words in pep talks and strategy ideas
- My app is a starting place, where to begin when you want to feel better, and it serves as one place to hold lots of resources for the user, rather than a bunch of apps that each do one thing
- The UI will be very simple and intuitive so that navigating and using the app doesn’t become another thing they have to worry about -- if the interface is at all difficult to deal with, it defeats the purpose of offering helpful solutions
- Other related apps I’ve looked at have ugly or confusing UI with small text and too many buttons, which puts too much pressure on the user 

####_Are there any constraints you have to work with? (e.g. technological, timing, content, etc.)_
- This weekend I will get the content together, and I don’t foresee issues with that because I have sources that I want to gather info from, but I need to make sure I have enough content to make this app feel useful, but it has to be quality content otherwise what’s the point?
- I want to have enough features so that this app is exciting/special, but not overload it so that it detracts from the goal

####_Is there anything else you think might help us (your stakeholders) understand what you’re proposing?_
- This weekend I will get the content together, and I don’t foresee issues with that because I have sources that I want to gather info from. I need to make sure I have enough content to make this app feel useful, but it has to be quality content otherwise what’s the point?
- I want to have enough features so that this app is exciting/special, but not overload it so that it detracts from the goal
- The tone of this app and these pep talks will be sincere yet light-hearted. It’s very important to me that this doesn’t come off as some cheesy self-help app meant only for people dealing with mental illness. It is for anyone who needs a pep talk when they’re stressed at work and need to go cry in the bathroom, or when they’re about to give a presentation but they’re steeped in self-doubt, or when they call their best friend because they feel like garbage, but there’s no answer.
- It’s a way to take a moment to ground yourself, but by getting that support from an external source (even if it is a pep talk that you wrote a few days ago), it takes the pressure off of you
