FRAG METHODS: 
(put them all together somewhere, maybe that's what abstract classes are for? they are making the other classes ugly and busy)

*	setupFrag(int id) - main act
		determines recyclerfrag or newfrag

*	setupNewFrag - pep talk and checklist act 
					(frag class determines which hint to set text)
		called from fab
		TODO figure out if i can set textviews from this method

*	setupEditFrag
		- called from recycleradapters
		- needs to acces the model from the cardview that launched it
		- if called from the RVfrag or ViewFragment, it needs to use .replace in the onlick rather than .add

*	setupViewFrag 
		- called from adapters directly
