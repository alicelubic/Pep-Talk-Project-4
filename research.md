###Research Plan
_Title:_ Pep Talk/stress management app plan and user research

_Author:_ Alice Lubic

_Date:_ 8/23/16

_Background:_ Personal interest in having an app geared towards stress management led me to research what is available - and I’ve found two types of apps: apps that have generic cheesy motivational quotes and links to speeches, and apps that have more technical psychology tips. I want an app that helps me organize my own ideas, that motivates me to cheer myself up and find my own solutions, and then it stores them so that I remember for the next time I’m feeling down. A simple app that helps me take an active approach to feeling better.

_Goals:_ To find out who would use an app to get personal pep talks, and what they would like to see in it.

_Research Questions:_
- Who uses self-help/motivational apps?
- What features would they find useful? Distracting?
- What other strategies do they have for handling moods, and how can those apply to this app?

_Methodology:_
- Interviews
- Research using the feedback for other similar apps in the Play Store

_Participants:_
- 17-30
- Those who deal with stress on a regular basis, and want a strategy to deal with it

_Schedule:_
- Recruiting: 8/23/16
- Study: 8/23/16-8/25/16
- Results: 8/25/16
- Script:
  - Do you use any self-help/mental health/lifestyle apps? Are they helpful?
  - What do you do when you want to cheer yourself up (on your phone)?
  - Do you ever ask friends/family for a pep talk? 
  - When you’re in an emotional rut, or dealing with lots of stress, what usually makes you feel better?


###Summaries of user research

_OBSERVATIONS: anything surprising? What did you hear?_
- The people I interviewed generally didn’t use any self-help/motivational/mood apps, but they all seemed interested in my idea when I told them about it at the end because of its interactive and customizable/add-your-own-content features

_INSIGHTS: what did you learn from observations_
- The interviewees would like to be encouraged to reach out to friends
- They have strategies and ideas to feel better when they feel down, but in the moment it’s hard to remember

_DESIGN RECOMMENDATIONS: how do the insights apply?_
- The interviewees suggested a visual way to up their moods, with some sort of photo gallery of images that make them feel good
- They like the idea of having links to further resources -- videos/reading/informational websites
- They thought that having a pep talk scheduled in the calendar before a certain upcoming stressful event would be beneficial

_NEW TOPICS/OPEN QUESTIONS TO RESEARCH FURTHER?_
- One interviewee suggested I look into principles of Mindfulness to help remind the user of a starting place to feel better

###Problem Statement and Hypothesis
- The user needs a way to reassure themselves, buck themselves up, and be reminded of their strategies when they're feeling down/stressed/overwhelmed because there isn't always a close friend/family member around to offer reassurance, and they need to start feeling better now.
- I believe that by creating an app that can deliver useful pep talks that can be edited and added to by the user, along with a place to keep all their feel-better strategies in one place, I will help the user to help themselves feel better when they need it most. I will know this to be true if and when we receive positive feedback from those who download this app.

###User Personas

_Persona 1:_

- Bio/Demographic details: 
  - Marco, 18
  - At the end of his freshman year in college
  - Uses his smartphone to its fullest capacity (lots of apps and organizational tools that he actually uses)
- Behaviors/habits:
  - Hard worker, puts a lot of pressure on himself to get good grades for grad school
  - Is often distracted by friends and social media, so he does most of his studying/work alone and isolated
- Stories/scenarios/frustrations:
  - Spending so much time alone really lets the stress build up in him, but reaching out to others is difficult
  - In-person pep talks often lead to a long conversation that he didn’t invite/doesn’t have time for
  - Reaching out to friends on social media leads to distractions, or his friends aren’t around when he needs them
  - Relying on himself to buck himself up and give himself pep talks used to work in high school, but the pressure is too much and the old strategies aren’t working
  - It’s easy to lose perspective when she’s stressed/feeling down
- Needs/problems/goals:
  - He wishes he could find a way to feel better and remind himself that everything is okay when he’s feeling badly, but doesn’t necessarily want to admit to others that he needs some help
  - He wants a way to get outside of his own head for a little, and get some advice any time he needs it

_Persona 2:_

- Bio/Demographic details:
  - Marie, 27
  - College graduate just started a new businessy/professional job
  - Former college athlete
- Behaviors/habits:
  - Exercises frequently
  - A self-starter, good at motivating herself to succeed
  - Likes to socialize, but doesn’t share information about her private life freely
- Stories/scenarios/frustrations:
  - Her last workplace environment was very mellow, but the new job is very formal and she’s receiving lots of negative feedback even though she’s working her hardest
  - Her coworkers are competitive, and there is pressure from them to work hard
  - She wants to do well but is feeling unsure of herself
- Needs/problems/goals:
  - She’s been given/given herself lots of pep talks during her athletic career, but the same ideas just aren’t cutting it under this new kind of pressure
  - She doesn’t want to admit to her coworkers or friends that she’s struggling, she’d rather reassure herself privately -- doesn’t want to be judged for needing help


###Prioritized Features
- A list of pep talks that the user can swipe through or access as a list, saved in Firebase
- Emergency pep talk widget
  - Maybe let user identify which pep talk should come up as default in the widget
- Checklist(s)/mindfulness
  - I will pre-populate with ideas, but that the user will be able to add to
  - Things to consider when you're feeling shitty, 
  - i.e. When was the last time you ate? Did you get enough sleep? Drink some water, take a deep breath. Do you need to be alone, or would you rather have some company?
- Links to resources
  - Embed audio or videos (icing)
- Sync to calendar, set a pep talk "alarm" before important events
- Encourage reaching out to friends
  - Facebook, email, text
  - "This pep talk wasn't enough? Maybe reach out to a friend, I know they'd love to hear from you!"
- Photo gallery/camera
- Incorporate sentiment analysis of text
- Maybe as an option when inserting your own pep talks

###Competitive Analysis
[Speadsheet] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/168VaqS8LH3cS_3WngDE3_--brLfMoSI-padlWbwubUU/edit?usp=sharing )

- From my competitive research, I’ve identified three types of apps in this genre:
  - Mood tracking apps that focus on statistical trends 
  - Motivational apps that show videos and links to motivational speeches
  - Mental health apps that give you specific tips for getting over mental illness - CBT, etc.
