# Pep Talk App


>A note to the instructors (I think Alan is grading this but I'm not sure): <br>
>Clearly I had a lot of features planned for this app that have not been implemented. Given some unforseen personal circumstances these last couple of weeks, I've done the best I can to meet the requirements, but I want you to know that I have learned so much in this course and I look forward to continuing to work on this until it better reflects what I am capable of. Thank you for everything.
